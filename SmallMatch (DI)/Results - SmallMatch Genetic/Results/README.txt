For the partition optimisation algorithm, we multipled values by 10^5 and then rounded values to the closest whole number.

The e=xx in the title refers to the error in the auxiliary data.

The population size used is 15 * n.

The number of swaps per mutation is a random number between 1 and 5. 

Tournament selection of k=6 was used. 

The maximum number of generations simulated for is 15 and the program stops if there is no improvement for 3 generations.

The data in the CSVs is self-explantory. The last column can be ignored.
