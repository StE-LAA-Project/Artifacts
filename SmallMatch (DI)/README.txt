In genetic_algorithm+probability_estimation.py:
	step_1 and step_2_3 correspond to the 1-step SmallMatch Greedy algorithm.
	the other functions correspond to the SmallMatch Genetic algorithm.
In gradient_descent.py:
	single-step gradient descent corresponds to Multistep SmallMatch Greedy.
	multi-step gradient descent corresponds to Optimized SmallMatch Greedy.
