The algorithm will terminate if no new indexes are involved in swaps after 20 iterations.
The algorithm considers making multiple steps in any iteration.

For the partition optimisation algorithm, values are rounded to the nearest 10000.

The e=xx in the title refers to the error in the auxiliary data.
The data in the CSVs is self-explantory. The last column can be ignored.
