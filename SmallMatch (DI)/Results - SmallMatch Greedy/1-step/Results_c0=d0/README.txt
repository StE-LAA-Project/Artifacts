In the structured encryption scheme on AWS, we only know c0 + d0 since we only know the total length of both table.

So one solution is to assume c0 == d0. This data will show by how much the performance is degraded.

e = xx refers to the amount of error in the auxiliary data.

For the partition optimization algorithm, we multiplied the values by 10^5 and then rounded the values to the closest whole numer.

The data in the CSVs is self-explantory. The last column can be ignored.
